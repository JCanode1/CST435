    "# CST-435 Recurrent Neural Network Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team: \n",
    "Gabriel Aracena, Aaron Galicia, Joshua Canode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment accomplishes two goals. It demonstrates how neural networks can be used in forecasting and how they can be used in practical applications involving text (e.g., completing a search request on Google).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a large set of texts for training, build an RNN that suggests the next word in a sentence (sequential learning). Consider the entire sentence when completing the sentence instead of words by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Goal of this project is to create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model that can predict the next word in a given sentence, thereby enabling the completion of sentences in a coherent and contextually relevant manner. The primary goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of neural networks in the field of text prediction, particularly for applications like search engine queries, chatbots, or predictive text input systems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to use a synthetic dataset generated by ChatGPT. The data contains a variety of short sentences. To introduce greater variety and enhance the diversity of the dataset, these sentences are categorized into questions, first-person perspectives, third-person perspectives, and different types of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm of the solution \n",
    "\n",
    "In the development of our RNN model, we followed a structured approach encompassing several pivotal phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: This involved gathering and preparing the dataset, including punctuation removal, tokenization, and integer encoding of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Many-to-One Sequence Mapping**: We formulated the problem as a many-to-one sequence mapping task, focusing on predicting the next word in a given sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Construction with Keras**: The RNN model was built using Keras, featuring multiple layers:\n",
    "    - An embedding layer for word representations\n",
    "    - A masking layer to handle words without embeddings\n",
    "    - An LSTM layer to capture sequential dependencies\n",
    "    - Dense layers for feature enhancement\n",
    "    - An output layer for predicting the next word\n",
    "    - Integration of pretrained GloVe word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Embedding Quality Assessment**: We evaluated the quality of these embeddings by analyzing cosine similarities between word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training with Model Checkpoint and Early Stopping**: To optimize training, we implemented techniques such as Model Checkpoint and Early Stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Text Generation Function**: A function for generating text predictions was developed, allowing the model to complete sentences.\n",

    "## Analysis of the findings  \n",
    "\n",
    "From manual evaluation, it is claer to see that the results are fairly good. The grammar and the sentance structure of the senctances are quite good.\n",
    "\n",
    "with this input text, \"*it's not just about winning; it's about the*\" we got sentance completions such as:\n",
    "- *But remember, it's not just about winning; it's about the new challenges as opportunities to grow and learn.*\n",
    "- *But remember, it's not just about winning; it's about the friends we make along the way.*\n",
    "And as expected with a higher temperature the reusulting sentances appear to be more interesting and creative, but make a little less sense. \n",
    "- *But remember, it's not just about winning; it's about the force her a jedi that how be that legend of the silence comes questions?*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The text generation results at various temperature settings demonstrate the impact of temperature on the diversity and coherence of generated text. Lower temperatures produce highly deterministic text closely tied to the input, while higher temperatures lead to more creative but potentially less coherent outputs. The choice of temperature depends on the desired balance between maintaining context and introducing novelty, making it a critical parameter for controlling the behavior of text generation models.\n",

    "I believe the training takes the entire training set as one big context instead of training on each sentence as a single context. This is probably why it generates long senteces that don't make much sense. We can change how the training is tokenized to fix this but I don't think its a big deal for the scope of this project. We can just add this thought to the conclusion. The project says to use the embedddings from the Glove algorithm, this is not implemented yet nor do I know if Artsi actually wants us to do that."
