    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Select a pool of 100 players from the data set, within a 5-year window.\n",
    "Define \"optimal team\" based on your decision of the player characteristics necessary to build a team. For example, if all 5 players are 3-point shooters, the team will miss defenders, which will make it unbalanced.\n",
    "Your task is to identify the optimal team of 5 players from that pool.\n",
    "Examine the multilayer neural network MLP architecture depicted in the \"CST-435 An Artificial Neural Network Model Image.\"\n",
    "Build a deep artificial neural network MLP to include the following: a) 1 input layer, b) as many hidden layers as you deem necessary, and c) an output layer fully connected to the hidden layers.\n",
    "Explain your architecture and how the basketball player characteristics are used as inputs.\n",
    "Activate the MLP by performing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting at the input layer, forward propagate the patterns of the training data through the network to generate an output.\n",
    "Based on the network's output, calculate the error that we want to minimize using a cost function that we will describe later.\n",
    "Backpropagate the error, find its derivative with respect to each weight in the network, and update the model.\n",
    "Repeat steps 1 through 3 for multiple epochs and learn the weights of the MLP.\n",
    "Use forward propagation to calculate the network output and apply a threshold function to obtain the predicted class labels in the one-hot representation.\n",
    "Interpret the output of your MLP in the context of selecting an optimal basketball team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to use a deep artificial neural network (ANN) to determine an optimal team composition from a pool of basketball players. Given player characteristics, we want to identify the best five players that result in a balanced team.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the NBA Players Dataset.\n",
    "* Filter to get a pool of 100 players from a random 5-year window.\n",
    "* Normalize/Standardize player characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANN Model Building:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) based on the architecture of the CST-435 An Artificial Neural Network Model Image (see below)\n",
    "* Define layers: Input layer, Hidden layers, and Output layer.\n",
    "* Determine the appropriate activation function, optimizer, and loss function for the MLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "![ANNModel](ANNModel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the ANN:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Forward propagation: Use player characteristics to propagate input data through the network and generate an output.\n",
    "* Calculate the error using a predefined cost function.\n",
    "* Backpropagate the error to update model weights.\n",
    "* Repeat the above steps for several epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation and Team Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use forward propagation on the trained ANN to predict player effectiveness or class labels.\n",
    "* Apply a threshold function to these predictions.\n",
    "* Select the top five players that meet the optimal team criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "* Input Layer: This layer will have neurons equal to the number of player characteristics we're considering (e.g. points, assists, offensive rebounds, defensive rebounds,etc.).\n",
    "* Hidden Layers: Multiple hidden layers can be used to capture intricate patterns and relationships. We initially thought we would do 5 hidden layers, one for each position,  but we decided to stick with only a single layer for simplicity and might change that later. \n",
    "* Output Layer: This layer can have neurons equal to the number of classes or roles in the team we're predicting for (e.g., point guard, shooting guard, center, etc.). Each neuron will give the likelihood of a player fitting that role.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Activation and Threshold Function\n",
    "\n",
    "During forward propagation, each neuron processes input data and transmits it to the next layer. An activation function is applied to this data. For this model, we can use the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function for hidden layers due to its computational efficiency and the ability to handle non-linearities. The softmax function might be applied to the output layer as it provides a probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the output, a threshold function is applied to convert continuous values into distinct class labels. In this case, it can be the player's most likely role in the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output provides us with a categorization of each player in our pool. By examining the predicted class labels and the associated probabilities, we can:\n",
    "* Identify which role or position each player is most suited for.\n",
    "* Select the top players for each role to form our optimal team.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define target values for each position and use hope to use that in the end of each training to classify if the output team was good or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the \"optimal\" team is contingent on the data provided and the neural network's training. For better results, the model should be regularly trained with updated data, and other external factors (like team chemistry and current form) should also be considered in real-world scenarios. For our optimal team we defined some weights based on each player position that will take into account the 2 most important stats for each position according to our criteria.
